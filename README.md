## Character recognition project for our 4th Sem MCA mini project

•	Character Recognition is an application used to identify characters and numbers for a given image.

•	To achieve this goal Character Recognition uses machine learning algorithms and computer vision methodologies. 

•	Character Recognition uses convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to identify characters in the text and enhance it for processing.

•	Character Recognition helps the end user in identifying the text in the image.

## Upload any text based image file to the ui and it will try to identify and display the output of the text in the image.
